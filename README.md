- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generates charts and graphs for market insights
- **Data Export**: Saves results to CSV format for further analysis

## üìã Requirements

### Python Libraries
```python
# Core libraries
import os
import time
import random
from datetime import datetime
from collections import Counter

# Data processing and analysis
import numpy as np

```

### Installation
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn fake-useragent ipython
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of two main agent classes:

### 1. WebSearchAgent
- **Purpose**: Simulates job searches across multiple platforms
- **Platforms Covered**:
  - LinkedIn (MENA region focus)
  - Bayt (Middle East jobs)
  - Wuzzuf (Egypt and North Africa)
  - Glassdoor (MENA region)
- **Features**:
  - Randomized user agents for realistic scraping simulation
  - Platform-specific URL templates
  - Caching mechanism for search results
  - Error handling and retry logic

### 2. DataExtractionAgent
- **Purpose**: Processes raw job data into structured format
- **Capabilities**:
  - Job title standardization
  - Location normalization
  - Skills extraction using keyword matching
  - Experience level parsing
  - Salary information extraction

## üìä Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Job Search Simulation**
   - Generates mock job postings based on real platform structures
   - Creates realistic job titles, companies, and descriptions
   - Randomizes posting dates and locations

2. **Data Standardization**
   - Normalizes job titles into standard categories
   - Standardizes location names to country level
   - Extracts technical skills using predefined keyword categories

3. **Analysis and Visualization**
   - Geographic distribution analysis
   - Skills demand ranking
   - Platform performance comparison
   - Experience level requirements

## üéØ Skill Categories Analyzed

The system categorizes skills into the following domains:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Java, C++, Scala, Julia
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, MXNet
- **Big Data**: Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Hive, Pig
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, spaCy, BERT, GPT, Transformer
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLO, ResNet, Object Detection
- **Analytics Tools**: SQL, NoSQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Excel
- **DevOps**: Git, CI/CD, Jenkins, Terraform

## üìà Generated Outputs

### 1. Data Export
- **File**: `Top_AI_ML_Jobs_MENA_May_2025.csv`
- **Contents**: Structured job data with extracted features

### 2. Visualizations
- Jobs per platform distribution
- Geographic job distribution
- Top 15 in-demand skills
- Job role rankings

### 3. Analysis Tables
- Top AI/ML job roles with rankings
- Most in-demand skills frequency
- Geographic distribution by country
- Experience level requirements
- Data source platform breakdown

## üåç Geographic Coverage

The tool analyzes job markets across MENA countries including:

- **Gulf States**: UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman
- **North Africa**: Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia
- **Levant**: Jordan

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
# Initialize agents
web_search_agent = WebSearchAgent()
data_extraction_agent = DataExtractionAgent()

# Search for AI jobs
raw_jobs = web_search_agent.search_jobs('AI')

# Process the data
df_jobs = data_extraction_agent.process_jobs(raw_jobs)

# Save results
df_jobs.to_csv('ai_jobs_analysis.csv', index=False)
```

### Custom Search
```python
# Search for specific roles
ml_jobs = web_search_agent.search_jobs('Machine Learning Engineer')
data_science_jobs = web_search_agent.search_jobs('Data Scientist')
```

## üìä Sample Output Structure

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| title | Standardized job title |
| company | Company name |
| location | Standardized country/region |
| platform | Source platform |
| posted_date | Job posting date |
| skills | List of extracted technical skills |
| experience_level | Required years of experience |
| salary | Extracted salary information |

## üîç Key Insights Generated

1. **Job Role Rankings**: Identifies most common AI/ML positions
2. **Skills Gap Analysis**: Shows which technical skills are most demanded
3. **Regional Opportunities**: Highlights job hotspots in MENA region
4. **Platform Effectiveness**: Compares job availability across platforms
5. **Experience Requirements**: Analyzes seniority level demands

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Simulation Mode**: Current implementation uses simulated data for demonstration
- **Real Implementation**: For production use, implement actual web scraping with proper rate limiting and robots.txt compliance
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with platform terms of service and data protection regulations
- **Legal Considerations**: Verify scraping permissions before deployment

## üîß Customization Options

### Adding New Platforms
```python
def _scrape_new_platform(self, url, max_pages):
    # Implement platform-specific scraping logic
    pass
```

### Extending Skill Categories
```python
self.skill_keywords['new_category'] = ['keyword1', 'keyword2', 'keyword3']
```

### Custom Location Mapping
```python
def _standardize_location(self, location):
    # Add custom location standardization rules
    pass
```

## üìù Future Enhancements
